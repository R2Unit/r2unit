# Hey there, fellow traveler of the galaxy!

Hey, I'm **Lorenzo**. For me, coding often feels like wielding the Force – incredibly powerful when it flows right! But let's be real, those syntax errors can feel like the dark side tempting you. I'm proud to be part of the 'Rebel Alliance' of developers, learning and building together. My personal mission is to contribute good, clean code and help bring balance to every project I touch.

## The Force of My Code ✨

- **Languages:** Go, Rust, C, C++, C#, TypeScript and HTML (with a sprinkle of cosmic magic)
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Docker, Git, and Borg 
- **Specialty:** Transforming coffee ☕️ into clean, bug-free code while taming the dark side of unexpected bugs.

## Projects 📒

Embark on a journey through some of my missions across the galaxy:

- **[Colours](https://github.com/r2unit/colours):** A Library in GoLang to add information to your logs based on output & colours. 
- **[Rusty Snake](https://github.com/r2unit/rusty-snake):** A simple snake game in Rust 

## A Call to All Padawans

Whether you're a seasoned Jedi or a budding Padawan, I'm always ready to collaborate. Feel free to explore my projects, drop a suggestion, or share your favorite Star Wars meme (because every rebel needs a laugh).
