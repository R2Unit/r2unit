# Hey there, fellow traveler of the code galaxy!

I'm **Cody** – a Jedi of JavaScript, a Sith of syntax errors, and a proud member of the Rebel Alliance of developers. My mission? To bring balance to the code force, one commit at a time.

## The Force of My Code

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, and sometimes even a bit of Huttese (just for fun!)
- **Frameworks & Tools:** React, Node.js, Docker, Git – my lightsabers in this digital universe.
- **Specialty:** Transforming coffee into clean, bug-free code and debugging the dark side (or vice versa, depending on the day).

## Galactic Projects

Embark on a journey through some of my missions across the galaxy:

- **[Hyperdrive Hub](#):** A web application that launches faster than the Millennium Falcon on a Kessel Run.
- **[Rebel Repo](#):** Open-source projects united under the cause of coding justice.
- **[Galaxy GraphQL](#):** A tool that queries data from across the universe without needing a hyperdrive boost.

## A Call to All Padawans

Whether you're a seasoned Jedi or a budding Padawan, I'm always ready to collaborate. Feel free to explore my projects, drop a suggestion, or simply share your favorite Star Wars meme (we all need a laugh when the code rebels).
