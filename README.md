# Hey there, fellow traveler of the galaxy!

Hey, I'm **Lorenzo**. For me, coding often feels like wielding the Force – incredibly powerful when it flows right! But let's be real, those syntax errors can feel like the dark side tempting you. I'm proud to be part of the 'Rebel Alliance' of developers, learning and building together – especially within the open-source galaxy, sharing knowledge freely like true Rebels.

## Harnessing the Code Force ✨

These are the abilities and tools I bring to the Alliance:

* **Languages I Wield:** Go, Rust, C, C++, C#, TypeScript, and HTML *(All infused with a sprinkle of cosmic magic)*

* **My Astromech Droids & Starship Systems:** Docker (for standardized transports), Git (my Jedi archive system), and Borg (for when you need... collective efficiency across the stars).

* **Primary Mission Objective:** Transforming coffee ☕️ into clean, reliable code and bravely battling the dark side of unexpected bugs.

## Projects 📒

Embark on a journey through some of my missions across the galaxy:

- **[Colours](https://github.com/r2unit/colours):** A Library in GoLang to add information to your logs based on output & colours. 
- **[Rusty Snake](https://github.com/r2unit/rusty-snake):** A simple snake game in Rust 

## A Call to All Padawans

Whether you're a seasoned Jedi or a budding Padawan, I'm always ready to collaborate. Feel free to explore my projects, drop a suggestion, or share your favorite Star Wars meme (because every rebel needs a laugh).
