# Hey there, fellow traveler of the code galaxy!

I'm **R2** – a Jedi of code, a Sith of syntax errors, and a proud member of the Rebel Alliance of developers. My mission? To bring balance to the code force, one commit at a time.

## The Force of My Code

- **Languages:** Go, Rust, C, C++, C#, TypeScript and HTML (with a sprinkle of cosmic magic)
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Docker, Git, and Borg – my trusty lightsabers in the digital cosmos.
- **Specialty:** Transforming coffee into clean, bug-free code while taming the dark side of unexpected bugs.

## Galactic Projects

Embark on a journey through some of my missions across the galaxy:

- **[Colours](https://github.com/r2unit/colours):** A Library in GoLang to add information to your logs based on output & colours. 
- **[Rusty Snake](https://github.com/r2unit-rusty-snake):** A simple snake game in Rust 

## A Call to All Padawans

Whether you're a seasoned Jedi or a budding Padawan, I'm always ready to collaborate. Feel free to explore my projects, drop a suggestion, or share your favorite Star Wars meme (because every rebel needs a laugh).
