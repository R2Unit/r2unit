# Hey there, fellow traveler of the code galaxy!

I'm **Cody** – a Jedi of JavaScript, a Sith of syntax errors, and a proud member of the Rebel Alliance of developers. My mission? To bring balance to the code force, one commit at a time.

## The Force of My Code

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, and sometimes even a bit of Huttese (just for fun!)
- **Frameworks & Tools:** React, Node.js, Docker, Git – my lightsabers in this digital universe.
- **Specialty:** Transforming coffee into clean, bug-free code and debugging the dark side (or vice versa, depending on the day).

## Galactic Projects

Embark on a journey through some of my missions across the galaxy:

- **[Hyperdrive Hub](#):** A web application that launches faster than the Millennium Falcon on a Kessel Run.
- **[Rebel Repo](#):** Open-source projects united under the cause of coding justice.
- **[Galaxy GraphQL](#):** A tool that queries data from across the universe without needing a hyperdrive boost.

## Galactic Animations

> "The Force is strong with this one..."

I love breathing life into static pages by crafting interactive animations that capture the epic battles of our favorite galaxy far, far away. Here are some of my animated experiments:

- **[Lightsaber Duel](#)**  
  Witness the elegant clash of light and dark in a mesmerizing lightsaber battle.

- **[Starfield Generator](#)**  
  Experience the thrill of hyperspace with a starfield animation that gives you the sensation of warp speed.

## Jedi Gameplay

> "Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things... But I do!"

When I'm not perfecting animations, I'm busy blending gameplay mechanics with my love for all things Star Wars. Check out these interactive projects:

- **[Rebel Run](#)**  
  Dodge Imperial obstacles and collect power-ups in this fast-paced, side-scrolling adventure.  
  *Demo:*

- **[Sith Invasion](#)**  
  Defend the galaxy against an onslaught of Sith drones in this tower-defense style game.  
  *Play online:* [Play Sith Invasion](#)

Stay tuned as I continue to push the boundaries of interactive cosmic adventures!
